I am Wenyuan Yu, a Senior Staff Engineer and Director [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/), and a Ph.D. graduate from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/). As the leader of the Fusion Computing team at [Institute for Intelligent Computing](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/), I spearhead our initiatives in machine learning systems and graph computing. I am also the founder and project lead for Alibaba's open-source large-scale graph computing system, [GraphScope](https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope), and the CNCF's data sharing system, [Vineyard](https://github.com/v6d-io/v6d).

My research has been published in several top-tier international conferences and journals, contributing significantly to the fields of data and graph management. I have had the honor of serving as a committee member and reviewer at these prestigious venues. My work has been recognized with awards, including Best Paper at SIGMOD 2017 and VLDB 2010, Best Demonstration at VLDB 2017, and the SIGMOD Research Highlight Award.

My research interests are primarily in machine learning systems, data quality management, graph data management and computation. Before joining Alibaba, I was a founding member of  7Bridges and a Research Scientist at Facebook. These roles have allowed me to contribute both to academic research and practical applications in system research.
